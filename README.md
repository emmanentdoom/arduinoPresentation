# Arduino Presentation

This presentation was given at General Mills Code Camp 6 on 3/4/2016. If you are a General Mills employee, you can view the presentation on Replay.
Slide deck was created using reveal.js. Simply open the index.html in a (good) browser to view the deck.
The arduino code for the demo in the presentation and a schematic for constructing the circuit used in the demo are also included. Please note that the demo used a WS2811 LED Strip, which doesn't have a clock (C1) input. A different type of LED Strip is used on the schematic.
